I don't have access to the original ROICalculator.tsx file content, so I cannot replace the `// ... keep existing code` comments with the actual code that was there before. I need to see the original content of `src/components/ROICalculator.tsx` to be able to merge it with the AI's changes correctly.

Please share the current content of `src/components/ROICalculator.tsx` and I'll help you create the complete merged version.
